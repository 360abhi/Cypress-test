1️⃣ Learn Cypress Basics (foundation before replication)
Understand Cypress architecture – how it runs inside browser but controls via Node.js process.

Learn basic test structure (describe, it, hooks like before, beforeEach).

Learn selectors & commands (cy.get(), cy.contains(), cy.click(), etc.).

Learn custom commands for reusable actions (like Playwright helper methods).

Understand fixtures (loading test data from JSON).

Learn how Cypress handles async automatically (no await needed).

2️⃣ Build POM Structure (Playwright model → Cypress model)
Create a pages folder – each page = class-like JS/TS file with methods for actions & assertions.

Keep test data separate (in /fixtures or via an external JSON file).

Implement Allure steps inside page methods (like Playwright’s @allure.step).

Add assertions inside POM methods (just like your Playwright style).

3️⃣ Allure Reporting Setup
Install Cypress Allure plugin (@shelex/cypress-allure-plugin).

Configure cypress.config.js with Allure writer plugin in setupNodeEvents.

Enable video & screenshots in config.

In page methods, wrap actions in Allure steps.

Set hooks (afterEach) to take screenshots automatically on failure.

Run tests with allure results directory, then generate report (allure serve).

4️⃣ Parallel Execution
Understand Cypress parallelization on CLI (--parallel --record with dashboard OR split tests via multiple runners in CI).

If using Docker/Jenkins, split spec files across different containers/nodes.

Keep browser launch lightweight (headless mode for CI).

5️⃣ Dockerize Cypress
Choose official Cypress Docker image (cypress/included) for ease.

Copy your test code & config into container.

Mount volumes for:

Test code

Allure results output folder (so host can access)

Run Cypress inside container headlessly.

6️⃣ Jenkins Integration
Install Allure Jenkins plugin.

In Jenkins pipeline:

Spin up Cypress in Docker (if using containers).

Run tests, output allure-results.

Use allure serve or Jenkins Allure plugin to publish.

Add parallel stages in Jenkinsfile for parallel execution.

7️⃣ Advanced Utilities (Optional but recommended)
Use Cypress tasks for:

File system operations (reading/writing JSON)

Calling backend APIs

Generating runtime data (like Faker) before tests start

Add custom commands in cypress/support/commands.js for repetitive actions.
